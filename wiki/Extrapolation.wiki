OptFlow also implements algorithms for image extrapolation by using a motion field. The following methods are currently implemented:

*Inverse pixel-based extrapolation* (dense motion fields)
 * For each pixel in the second source image, find the corresponding pixel in the first source image. Requires an inverse motion field (I2->I1).
*Forward mesh extrapolation* (sparse motion fields)
 * Construct a textured triangle mesh from the first source image and transform the mesh by using a forward motion field (I1->I2).
